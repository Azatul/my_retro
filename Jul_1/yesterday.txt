Yesterday, we are given the inroduction to the Software Development programme.
We learned how to use the git command in GitBash to save the file from GitHub into the local file.
We use git clone, git add, git commit and git push.
The change we made in Cursor is updated into the GitHub using a GitBash.
We also learn how we can study by only using chatGPT.
