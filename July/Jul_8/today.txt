Today we do the presentation for the frontend of CRUD. 
Learnt many terms, still need to read more. Also the detailed process and coding.
A little bit about pattern matching.
Today we learn how to alter the table we already created in my_app. Using the mix ecto.gen.migration add_users_table.
Here we need to add the field and fields type in the migrations file we created. 
To check status of migration we need to use the mix ecto.migrations. If it's up it is migrated and if down not yet.
