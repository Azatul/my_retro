Today we learnt about HTML, CSS and tailwind fundamentals.
The concept is easy to understand. But most of the code is done by chatGPT, I only changed a few parts needed.
The HTML is the skeleton, CSS the skin and tailwind is the mix of CSS into the HTML (just in my understanding).
In CSS we have three type, inline, internal and external.
We also come across learning the responsive UI which is to make the screen view neat for other devices. 
If we use the tailwind, we won't need to have the css files as we edit it straight in the HTML line.
