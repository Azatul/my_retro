Today we learn about the system analysis and design. 
We need to remember 4 which is Planning, Analysis, Design and Implementation. 
In planning we need to know about what our problem is and also how the system help solve the problem. Also determine the user/
In Analysis it will be a deeper analyisis of the system by useing the chatGPT to get more insights about the system. 
What user do and what features needed and so on.
In Design, outline how will the system work and look , the useflow and what data do we need.
Implementation stage is where the user will satrt to code and develop the system, do etsting, let people use it and get as much feedback for improvement.
Fix problems and update if needed.
