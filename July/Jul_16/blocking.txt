Today's blocking is more to error in codding.
The first error happen because I put the data before adding the user name column into the lisitng loans and thus the system shows map error.
Can be fixed by deleting the loan data first and then try to run agauin. 
Actually before I got into this I got into more error such as I forgot to add a few things in a few files and then also has made a mistake in a few parts but managed to get by itby comparing.
Since the first time I can't get it, I tried again and redo a second app. Then this time the error is the save buuton cannot be clocked.
I can't solve also and do a third time, this time I compare the files carefully with how sir did it and can finally run it.
