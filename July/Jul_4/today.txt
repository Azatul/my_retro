Today we learn about FIGMA and also Relume.io. These two websites help us to design our website system Wireframe.
In relume.io, we can generate our system wireframe easily.
We then can export it into the Figma website and edit it from there.
The use of chatGPT to generate ideas about our wireframe also helped a lot in understanding how to design the wireframe.
Homepage is the sale page for our app, it attracts the user to explore the website. So it needed to be attractive.
