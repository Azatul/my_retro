Today we learn how to update the file in our local files into the remote GitHub repository.
We do it by using the GitBash and just follow the instructions in the GitHub repository we created.
Then, we open cursor to update the change we made in cursor easily by using the commit change in the Git icon.
We need to sync and it will be updated in our repository.
Next we proceed with the mix phx.gen.live to generate the Liveview CRUD interface.
We also use the command mix ecto.migrate and iex -S mix phx.server.
We do this by first asking chatGPT on how to create the command with its fields and fieldstype.
Then in the router we change the code by also using the code the chatGPT provided and make sure the router code is same.
Start the server with  iex -S mix phx.server.
