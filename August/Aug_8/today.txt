Today we continue with Figma design, learnt about modal, pop up and hover. 
Modal is usually for form where user need to click on cancel button etc first before it collapse.
Hover is when we move the cursor to the area will show the hover, mostly only for view.
Pop up is the message after clicking delete, save etc. A notofication that will hover for a while and then gone.
Almost done with our design, but mostlyu are already done. Still need to be reviewed by our instructor.
